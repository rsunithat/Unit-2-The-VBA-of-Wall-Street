### Easy

* Create a script that will loop through each year of stock data and grab the total amount of volume each stock had over the year.

* You will also need to display the ticker symbol to coincide with the total volume.

* Your result should look as follows (note: all solution images are for 2015 data).

* Use the sheet `alphabetical_testing.xlsx` while developing your code. This dataset is smaller and will allow you to test faster. Your code should run on this file in less than 3-5 minutes.

* Make sure that the script acts the same on each sheet. The joy of VBA is to take the tediousness out of repetitive task and run over and over again with a click of the button.

## Submission

* To submit please upload the following to Github:

  * A screen shot for each year of your results on the Multi Year Stock Data.

  * VBA Scripts as separate files.
